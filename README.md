# WEBSITE-FILES
 Files associated with my personal website project

This is a personal website project. I have never taken an UI class but wanted to have a website as I will be looking for a job next year and also wanted to the practice of creating a functioning anything with code. We do a lot less of that than I thought we would in school. The links on the website will be to my YouTube videos, my music, and also my coding projects. I started with a template that I have linked below and will modify it in order to learn more.
